## informall

A misinfocon hackathon project that brings libraries and journalists closer together by providing a list of geolocated resources. informall has a database of public library locations (with more library types to come) and the electronic databases they subscribe to, as well as newspapers, radio and television stations in their geographic area.

During the hackathon we will implement both a search and a map-based interface for this data.

News data is taken from the [Local Memory Project] (https://github.com/harvard-lil/local-memory/tree/master/LocalMemoryProject/Sources/USA)

Library data is taken from [IMLS Public Library Survey] (https://www.imls.gov/research-evaluation/data-collection/public-libraries-survey/explore-pls-data/pls-data)
